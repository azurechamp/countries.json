countries.json
==============

Countries JSON is a fork of http://bdhacker.wordpress.com/2009/11/21/adding-dropdown-country-state-list-dynamically-into-your-html-form-by-javascript/

This is designed to be used in an modular javascript application which may want to re-order the structure of the Countries without having to overhaul the entire file.
